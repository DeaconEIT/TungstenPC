# TungstenPC  

## Description  

This assessment aims to plan and control our hypothetical software development project TungstenPC (e-commerce) with supporting documentation. All project planning, documentation, and code must be developed, contained and managed in a GitHub repository. The focus is on familiarising the processes and tools for managing a software project. The main objective is to obtain and apply project management experience to develop websites.

## Iteration 1  

This iteration includes key project documentation such as the stakeholder registry, personas, persona impact report, group meeting reports, and a progress report. The stakeholder registry identifies and categorizes key stakeholders involved in the project. The three personas provide insights into user needs, behaviors, and expectations, while the persona impact report analyzes their influence on project decisions. Additionally, two group meeting reports document our team's discussions, progress, and decisions over two weeks. Lastly, the progress report offers a structured summary of the work completed during this iteration.
