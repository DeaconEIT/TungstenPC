Description
This assessment aims to plan and control our hypothetical software development project TungstenPC (e-commerce) with supporting documentation. All project planning, documentation, and code must be developed, contained and managed in a GitHub repository. The focus is on familiarising the processes and tools for managing a software project. The main objective is to obtain and apply project management experience to develop websites.

Iteration 3
This iteration includes comprehensive documentation covering the User Acceptance Tests, Risk Registry, Progress Report, and Group Meeting Reports. The Risk Registry identifies potential risks associated with the project, evaluating the likelihood of their occurrence and their potential impact on project outcomes. The User Acceptance Tests provide a detailed assessment of the website’s functionality, highlighting both successful features and areas requiring improvement—critical insights for stakeholder review. Additionally, the progress report and group meeting reports document our achievements for this iteration, along with discussions, decisions, and plans formulated during team meetings.
