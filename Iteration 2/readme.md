# TungstenPC


## Description
---
This assessment aims to plan and control our hypothetical software development project TungstenPC (e-commerce) with supporting documentation. All project planning, documentation, and code must be developed, contained and managed in a GitHub repository. The focus is on familiarising the processes and tools for managing a software project. The main objective is to obtain and apply project management experience to develop websites.

## Iteration 2
This iteration includes comprehensive documentation on the resource table, Agile Gantt chart, progress report, and group meeting reports. The resource table outlines the budget required for each iteration, detailing the necessary resources and the steps needed for completion. The Agile Gantt chart provides a structured timeline that tracks progress and key milestones throughout the project. Additionally, the progress report and group meeting reports document our achievements for this iteration, along with discussions, decisions, and plans formulated during team meetings.
